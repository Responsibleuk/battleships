## Introductions

Battleship was originally designed as a guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of battleships are marked. 

The locations of the battleships are concealed from the other player. 

Players alternate turns firing at the other player's ships, by calling the grid location using columns and rows.

The objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

The game was first developed in world war 1 where users used pen and paper, it has since been turned into a board game and computer game in this project I will create a battleship game built in python3 where user plays against the computer.
